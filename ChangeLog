	* lib/candlepin-api/version.rb (CandlepinAPI): Updated to version
	0.4.0; added more API versions and about to go public.  Also, we
	now have a *real* updated version of the Cri gem, so we don't need
	to maintain our own.  Cleaned up Bundler's setup.rb file a bit.

	* lib/candlepin-api/version.rb (CandlepinAPI): Updated to version
	0.3.0.

	* candlepin-api.gemspec: Added rubyforge_project and home_page
	values, and fixed rdoc_options to be backward-compatible with
	older RDoc versions.

	* lib/candlepin-api/base.rb (CandlepinAPI::Endpoint#submit):
	Repaired handling of request header so it can be inherited from
	any settings applied by the constructor.
	(CandlepinAPI::Endpoint#initialize): Special-case a :header key in
	an argument hash so it can be preserved as the request header
	definition at #submit time.  Removed Red Hat-specific references.
	(CandlepinAPI::Endpoint#qparam): Added #net_http_request reader to
	allow access to request header and other aspects.  Removed Red
	Hat-specific references.
	(CandlepinAPI::Endpoint#to_s): Fixed assembly of request URI so
	that path segments specified in the server-URI are retained.

	* bin/candlepin-api (#status_line): Added --header-field/-H and
	--request-header/-I, plus display of request header on demand.
	Added self.context#[] and #[]= to access the request header fields
	being added.

	* Rakefile: Made the parse_versions task take the mtime of the API
	generator script into account (if it's newer than the output
	files, run it).

	* script/mkclasses-from-API.rb (CandlepinAPI): Added code to
	include the --data/-d option in each entrypoint description.  Also
	regenerated all the API and CLI files.

	* bin/candlepin-api (CandlepinCLI#subcommand): Added --data/-d
	option for passing JSON request body.

	* lib/candlepin-api/version.rb (CandlepinAPI): Update the package
	version to 0.2.0 due to new functionality.

	* candlepin-api.gemspec: Added directives to avoid trying to
	document all the auto-generated filed.
